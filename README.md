## Learning Resources

**A note from dvcoders to you...**

> As you begin to learn how to create your projects, remember a few things. 
> 
> One, there is too much information about development and programming for one person to learn in their lifetime. So don't feel as though you need to read every link fully and completely.
> 
> Two, we helped make this small collection so that you will **learn how to learn** through online resources. If in one year you decided that "I want to learn Android programming", you will know **how to find material** to tech yourself. All you need is Google.
> 
> Three, take small pieces of information from each resource. If you're brand new, do the interactive tutorials. If you're more confident as a programmer, **read documentation and books** because it's good practice for learning in a professional environment.
> 
> Feel free to ask us for advice or feedback about any resources or questions you have.
> 
> -Happy coding.
